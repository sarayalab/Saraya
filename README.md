To run the program use `npx expo run:android`. But before that please check:
1. Whether npm install includes new dependencies or not, if yes (the reading is usually `x vulnerabilities (x1 low, x2 moderate, x3 high) To address issues that do not require attention, run:npm audit` fix please report to the team with the version needed accordingly (what is shown on the audit message)
2. Whether `local.properties` files exists or not. This file should be autogenerated by Android Studio, if not, contact the team for templates that might not be included in git then change the SDK directory according to your local SDK directory. The position of `local.properties` should be inside android folder

If things are checked, `npx expo run:android` should work.
